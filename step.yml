  xccov-proc
summary: |
  A Bitrise step that processes Xcode coverage reports with support for file exclusions, YAML-based configurations, 
  and detailed coverage analysis for enhanced CI/CD workflows.
description: |
  xccov-proc is an open-source Bitrise step designed to streamline the processing of Xcode coverage reports (xccov). 
  It enables teams to analyze and customize their code coverage data during CI/CD workflows by providing features such as:
    * Targeted Coverage Analysis: Focus on specific targets within your project using the --target flag.
    * File Exclusion: Exclude files from coverage calculations using command-line arguments or a YAML-based configuration file.
    * Custom Coverage Metrics: Automatically recalculate coverage data after exclusions, providing up-to-date metrics.
    * Flexible Configuration: Supports command-line flags and YAML configuration for seamless integration into diverse project setups.
  This step is ideal for teams looking to automate and refine their code coverage workflows, ensuring cleaner and more actionable coverage 
  reports as part of their Bitrise pipelines.

# If this step should be available only for certain project types
# just uncomment this `project_type_tags` section and include all the
# project types supported by the step. If the step can be used for all
# project types then you can just remove this section.
# If no `project_type_tags` specified (or specified as an empty array)
# that means the step can be used for any project type.
# You can find more information about project type tags in the Step Development Guideline:
# https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise/blob/master/_docs/step-development-guideline.md

# Type tags are used for categorizing steps, for easier step discovery in Step Libraries.
